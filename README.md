# Object-Detection-using-Arduino-UNO-Ultrasonic-Sensor
In this project, I developed an innovative hardware solution utilizing an Arduino Uno board paired with an ultrasonic sensor to create a real-time object detection system. The primary objective was to visualize the presence of objects in front of the sensor through a dynamic radar graph displayed on a computer screen.
