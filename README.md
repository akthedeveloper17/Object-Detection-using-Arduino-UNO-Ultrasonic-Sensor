# Object-Detection-using-Arduino-UNO-Ultrasonic-Sensor
In this project, I developed an innovative hardware solution utilizing an Arduino Uno board paired with an ultrasonic sensor to create a real-time object detection system. The primary objective was to visualize the presence of objects in front of the sensor through a dynamic radar graph displayed on a computer screen.
The system operates by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. This data is processed by the Arduino, which calculates the distance to the detected object. The radar graph is designed to provide an intuitive visual representation of the detection status: when an object is detected within a specified range, the radar graph highlights the area in red, indicating a "red zone." Conversely, when no objects are present, the graph shifts to a green zone, signaling safety and absence of obstacles.

Key features of the project include:

---> Real-time Object Detection: The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the environment, providing instant feedback on object presence.
---> Visual Feedback: The radar graph offers an easy-to-understand visual cue, making it accessible for users to interpret the sensor's data quickly.

---> Arduino Integration: Leveraging the capabilities of the Arduino Uno, the project showcases the versatility of microcontrollers in creating interactive hardware solutions.

---> User -Friendly Interface: The graphical representation on the computer screen enhances user interaction and engagement with the system.

This project not only demonstrates my skills in hardware development and programming but also highlights my ability to integrate technology with practical applications. It serves as a foundation for further exploration into automation and smart sensing technologies. I am excited to share this project as part of my journey in the field of electronics and embedded systems.
